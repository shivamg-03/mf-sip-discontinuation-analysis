# Mutual Fund SIP Discontinuation Analysis

An end-to-end analytics project investigating why mutual fund investors stop their SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) — built across Excel, MySQL, Python, and Power BI to simulate a real BFSI/fintech analytics workflow.

---

## Business Problem

Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) discontinuation is a silent drag on AMC (Asset Management Company) revenue. Every lapsed SIP means lost recurring AUM, wasted acquisition cost, and a missed long-term investor relationship. Most AMCs only notice churn *after* it's happened — there's rarely a system flagging an investor **before** the third missed payment locks in a permanent lapse.

This project asks three business questions:
1. **Who** is at risk of discontinuing their SIP?
2. **When** in their investment lifecycle does risk peak?
3. **What early signals** (ticket size, category, missed-payment pattern) predict a lapse before it's final?

Churn is operationally defined as **3 consecutive missed monthly SIP payments** — the point at which most AMCs treat a SIP as functionally dead.

> **Note on data:** Real investor-level SIP data is not publicly available. This project uses a synthetically generated investor-month panel designed to mirror realistic SIP behavior patterns, so the pipeline and findings remain representative of real-world churn dynamics even though the underlying rows are simulated.

## Dataset

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Rows | 15,509 (investor-month panel) |
| Investors | 660 |
| Schemes | 21 |
| SEBI Categories | 10 |
| Time window | 36 months (Jul 2023 – Jun 2026) |
| Churn definition | 3 consecutive missed SIP payments |

Key columns: `investor_id`, `month_date`, `scheme_code`, `scheme_name`, `sebi_category`, `sip_amount`, `nav_value`, `payment_status`, `discontinued`, `tenure_months`, `city_tier`, `occupation_type`, `age`.

## Pipeline
Excel → MySQL (8 advanced SQL queries) → Python EDA (5 charts) → Statistical Validation (3 hypothesis tests) → Power BI (2-page dashboard)


---

### Phase 1 — Excel: Initial Exploration

Built an `at_risk_flag` using `COUNTIF` as a first-pass, non-consecutive missed-payment proxy before the real churn logic was built in SQL.

![COUNTIF at-risk formula](screenshots/P1_02a_countifs_formula.png)
![At-risk summary](screenshots/P1_02b_countifs_summary.png)

**Result: 4,008 rows flagged at-risk (25.84%)** — a row-level proxy, later superseded by investor-level SQL logic.

Pivot tables broke this down by category, city tier, and ticket size:

![Churn by city tier](screenshots/P1_06_pivot_citytier_churn.png)
![Churn by SIP ticket band](screenshots/P1_07_pivot_sipband_churn.png)

Early finding: city tier showed no meaningful churn pattern (23.03% / 18.20% / 27.13%) — a useful null result, not a bug (later statistically confirmed in Phase 5). File: `mf_sip_analysis_phase1.xlsx`

### Phase 2 — MySQL: 8 Advanced SQL Queries

Data loaded via Python (`sqlalchemy` + `pymysql`) into a `sip_transactions` table (15,509 rows confirmed on load).

| Query | Technique | Business Question |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | `LAG()` + gaps-and-islands CTE | Which investors show 3+ consecutive missed payments? |
| Q2 | `RANK()` partitioned by category | Who are the highest-risk investors within each SEBI category? |
| Q3 | `NTILE(4)` | How does churn vary across 4 equal-sized risk quartiles? |
| Q4 | Running window aggregate | How does an investor's reliability evolve month-over-month? |
| Q5 | `LEAD()` | How often does a single miss turn into a confirmed 3-miss streak vs. recover? |
| Q6 | `DENSE_RANK()` per category | Which specific schemes have the highest churn within their category? |
| Q7 | CTE + `AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY category)` | How does an investor's lapse tenure compare to their category's average? |
| Q8 | Cohort grouping + `COUNT(DISTINCT)` + `RANK()` | What % of each monthly cohort remains active over time? |

![Q1 streak detection](screenshots/P2_Q1_streak_detection_result.png)
![Q2 rank by category](screenshots/P2_Q2_rank_by_category_result.png)
![Q3 risk quartiles](screenshots/P2_Q3_risk_quartile_result.png)
![Q4 running reliability](screenshots/P2_Q4_running_reliability_result.png)
![Q5 early warning](screenshots/P2_Q5_early_warning_result.png)
![Q6 scheme-level churn rank](screenshots/P2_Q6_scheme_discontinuation_rank.png)
![Q7 tenure deviation](screenshots/P2_Q7_tenure_deviation_result.png)
![Q8 cohort retention](screenshots/P2_Q8_cohort_retention_curve.png)

**Cross-validation finding:** Q1 (LAG), Q5 (LEAD), and Q8 (cohort) each *independently* returned **264 discontinued investors**, confirming the churn logic is internally consistent across three different SQL techniques.

### Phase 3 — Python EDA: 5 Charts

Environment: Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib. Connected to MySQL via SQLAlchemy.

![SIP discontinuation rate by category — chart](screenshots/P3_01_churn_by_category_chart.png)
![SIP discontinuation rate by category — table](screenshots/P3_01_churn_by_category_table.png)

Small Cap Equity is the highest-risk category (93.06%), Liquid Fund the lowest (11.43%).

![Tenure at discontinuation](screenshots/P3_02_tenure_to_churn_histogram.png)

Mean tenure at lapse: 12.9 months, median 12, range 3–32 months.

![Discontinuation by ticket size](screenshots/P3_03_ticket_size_vs_churn.png)

Clean inverse relationship: Low (≤₹1,000) tickets churn at 51.47%, High (>₹3,000) at 31.50%.

![Fatal streak length distribution](screenshots/P3_04_streak_length_distribution.png)

The vast majority of churned investors (≈245 of 315 streaks) lapse at *exactly* the minimum 3-month threshold — confirming the churn definition captures a real behavioral cliff, not an arbitrary cutoff.

![Cohort retention curves](screenshots/P3_05_cohort_retention_curve.png)

**Methodology finding:** row-level averaging of the `discontinued` flag systematically **underestimates** true investor-level churn. This was caught during Phase 3 and corrected using `DISTINCTCOUNT` / `COUNT(DISTINCT investor_id)` logic in both SQL and DAX.

### Phase 5 — Statistical Validation: 3 Hypothesis Tests

Environment: same Jupyter notebook as Phase 3, using `scipy.stats`. The goal of this phase is to confirm whether the visual patterns from Phase 3 are statistically real or could be due to chance — a critical distinction for any recommendation built on this data.

**Test 1 — Category vs. Discontinuation (Chi-square test of independence)**

- H0: SEBI category and discontinuation are independent
- H1: SEBI category and discontinuation are NOT independent
- **Result:** χ² = 189.38, df = 9, p < 0.0001 → **Reject H0.** Category is statistically significantly associated with discontinuation, confirming the pattern in Chart 1 is not due to chance.

**Test 2 — SIP Ticket Size vs. Discontinuation (Independent samples t-test)**

- H0: mean SIP amount is the same for discontinued and active investors
- H1: mean SIP amount differs between the two groups
- **Result:** mean SIP amount ₹2,357.95 (discontinued) vs. ₹2,791.67 (active); t = -2.31, p = 0.0212 → **Reject H0.** Lower ticket size is significantly associated with higher churn, though the effect is meaningfully weaker than the category effect above.

**Test 3 — City Tier vs. Discontinuation (Chi-square test of independence)**

- H0: city tier and discontinuation are independent
- H1: city tier and discontinuation are NOT independent
- **Result:** χ² = 2.99, df = 2, p = 0.2242 → **Fail to reject H0.** City tier shows no statistically significant association with discontinuation, confirming the earlier Phase 1 (Excel) null-result observation rather than just eyeballing similar-looking percentages.

| Test | Variable | Result | p-value | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | SEBI Category | χ² = 189.38 | p < 0.0001 | Strong, significant driver |
| 2 | SIP Ticket Size | t = -2.31 | p = 0.0212 | Weaker, still significant driver |
| 3 | City Tier | χ² = 2.99 | p = 0.2242 | Not significant (confirmed null) |

**Business takeaway:** Statistical testing confirms category is the dominant churn driver, ticket size is a real but secondary driver, and city tier can be safely excluded from retention targeting — turning three visual observations into three statistically validated business decisions.

## Key Findings

- **Investor-level churn rate: 40%** (264 of 660), independently confirmed via 3 separate SQL techniques (LAG, LEAD, cohort analysis)
- **Category risk is highly uneven and statistically significant** (χ² = 189.38, p < 0.0001): Small Cap Equity (93%), Mid Cap Equity (73%), and Flexi Cap Equity (67%) are the highest-risk categories; Liquid Fund (11%) and Debt – Short Duration (16%) are the most stable
- **Smaller ticket size = significantly higher churn** (t = -2.31, p = 0.0212): investors on ≤₹1,000 SIPs churn at 51%, vs. 31% for >₹3,000 SIPs — a real but weaker driver than category
- **The 3-month threshold is a real behavioral cliff**, not an arbitrary rule — most churned investors lapse at exactly 3 consecutive misses
- **City tier is confirmed statistically to NOT be a churn driver** (χ² = 2.99, p = 0.2242) — a deliberate, statistically validated null result that prevented over-fitting a spurious pattern
- **Risk quartiles are not perfectly monotonic**: the lowest-missed-payment quartile (Q4) still showed a 48.48% eventual discontinuation rate, higher than the two middle quartiles — missed-payment count alone doesn't fully predict churn
- **Scheme-level churn varies sharply within the same category** (Q6) — e.g. Midcap Advantage Fund churns at 71% while other schemes in the same category churn far less, meaning category-level fixes alone would miss scheme-specific problems

---

## Business Recommendations

1. **Prioritize retention outreach by category, not uniformly.** Small Cap, Mid Cap, and Flexi Cap Equity investors account for a disproportionate share of churn — concentrate retention budget here first rather than spreading it evenly across all 10 categories. This is the strongest statistically validated lever (Phase 5, Test 1).

2. **Intervene at the first missed payment, not the third.** Q5 shows only 6.58% of single misses become a confirmed 3-month streak — but once a streak starts, the fatal-streak-length analysis shows it almost always ends at exactly 3 months. This means the highest-leverage intervention point is the **first missed payment**, not waiting for the pattern to confirm itself.

3. **Encourage step-up SIPs or minimum ticket nudges.** Low-ticket investors (≤₹1,000) churn at nearly double the rate of high-ticket investors, a statistically confirmed (if secondary) effect. A step-up SIP feature or a modest minimum-ticket recommendation at onboarding could measurably reduce this segment's churn.

4. **Investigate underperforming schemes individually, not just their category.** Q6 shows churn varies sharply *within* the same SEBI category — e.g., Midcap Advantage Fund churns far more than category peers. Fund managers should review fees, performance, and communication for these specific schemes rather than assuming category-wide fixes will help.

5. **Time engagement campaigns around month 10–12 of tenure.** With median lapse tenure at 12 months, proactive check-ins, portfolio reviews, or loyalty incentives timed just before the 1-year mark could catch investors before the risk period peaks.

6. **Don't rely on missed-payment count alone for risk scoring.** The non-monotonic quartile result (Q3) shows churn risk needs to combine missed-payment count with ticket size and category — a multi-factor risk score would outperform any single signal.

7. **Deprioritize city-tier-based segmentation.** Phase 5 statistically confirms city tier has no significant relationship with churn (p = 0.2242) — retention budget should not be allocated by geography.

## Business Solution

The deliverable is a **two-page, self-service Power BI dashboard** that lets a retention or operations team — without needing SQL or Python skills — monitor the overall churn picture (Page 1) and drill into the specific drivers behind it (Page 2). This turns a one-time analysis into a repeatable, filterable tool: a retention manager can filter to a single cohort month, category, or city tier and immediately see which investor segment needs outreach this month, rather than waiting on an analyst to rerun a report. The underlying recommendations are additionally backed by formal hypothesis testing (Phase 5), so the tool isn't just descriptive — its top-line guidance is statistically validated.

## Limitations & Next Steps

- Dataset is synthetically generated; directional findings (ticket size, category risk) are illustrative of real-world SIP behavior but not derived from actual AMC data
- The dashboard uses a filtered detail table rather than true Power BI drill-through, due to time constraints
- The cohort retention matrix on Page 2 is binned at a coarser interval (every ~12 months) rather than true month-by-month granularity
- Statistical tests (Phase 5) assume independence of observations at the investor level; no correction for multiple comparisons was applied since only 3 tests were run
- Next iteration: replace the synthetic panel with real AMFI NAV/AUM data where investor-level granularity becomes available, and add a predictive churn-scoring model (e.g. logistic regression) combining tenure, ticket size, category, and missed-payment streaks
